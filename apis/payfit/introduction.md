# Welcome

👋 Welcome to PayFit developer documentation. We are building an API to create smooth integrations with other products.

🎯 This API is meant for PayFit partner companies, not (yet) for PayFit customers to consume their own data.

📝 If you are representing a company who would like to access the PayFit API, please contact us directly with this [contact form](https://payfit-survey.typeform.com/to/BlNA24bh).

# What can I do with this API ?

**🔄 Syncing Employees**

You can use this API to retrieve employee contracts and deduce the employees you would like to see in your application.

This API expose a list of employee contracts, and an employee can have multiple contracts. For example, if a person is hired for an internship and then for a long-term contract, the API will return 2 different contracts. Beware not to create duplicates in your database !

💡 You can use properties like `lastName`, `birthName`, `firstName` and `birthDate` to match employees with a good accuracy.

# Getting started
