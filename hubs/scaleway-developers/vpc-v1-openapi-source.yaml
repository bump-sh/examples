    # Introduction

    VPC is a set of products and features allowing you to build your own virtual private cloud on top
    of Scaleway's shared public cloud. It currently consists of Private Networks, which allows
    instances to be interconnected through a dedicated, private, and flexible
    [L2 network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer).

    You can add as many servers to your networks as you want, and add up to eight (8) different networks
    per server, taking the form of additional network interfaces inside your instance. This allows you
    to run services isolated from the public internet and expose them to the rest of your
    infrastructure without worrying about public network filtering.

    Instances can be plugged and unplugged from a network at will, even when the instance is running:
    the network interface will be hot-plugged to the server, and software can be configured to
    automatically set it up as soon as it appears.

    ## Technnical limitations

    - A maximum of eight (8) private networks can be plugged to any single instance
    - The MAC address of an instance in a network cannot be changed
    - Broadcast and Multicast traffic, while supported, are heavily rate-limited

    # Quick start guide

    ## Step 0: Prerequisites

    You need to have an HTTP client such as [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se) to use Scaleway API. It is
    also a good idea to have [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq) which will help you to read and parse
    JSON output. Make sure you have these two tools before you begin. Otherwise use your package manager
    to install them.

    To call Scaleway API, you need an `X-Auth-Token`. If you don't have one yet, refer to our
    [doc about generating API keys](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/scaleway-project/#-Generating-API-Keys).

    Next, you will need your Project ID to create VPC resources in. If you don't have it, refer to our
    [doc about creating a Project](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/scaleway-project/#-Creating-a-Project).

    Finally, you will need to chose the Availability Zone in which to create your Private Networks.
    Keep in mind that Private Networks are per zone and not per region, thus you will only be able to
    connect Instances to networks from the same Availability Zone.

    ```sh
    export SECRET_KEY="<Secret key of your token>"
    export PROJECT_ID="<Chosen Project ID>"
    export ZONE="<Chosen zone (fr-par-1/nl-ams-1)>"
    ```

    ## Step 1: Create a Private Network

    You can customize the name, tags and project ID for the created Private Network.

    ```sh
    curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $SECRET_KEY" \
        https://api.scaleway.com/vpc/v1/zones/$ZONE/private-networks \
        -d '{"name": "My awesome Private Network", \
             "project_id": "'$PROJECT_ID'" \
             "tags": ["test", "step1"]}'
    ```

    Keep the `id` field of the response: it is your Private Network ID, and is useable across all
    Scaleway products that support Private Networks. Since it will be used in the next steps, we will
    put it in a variable for the sake of readability.

    ```sh
    export PN_ID="<Your Private Network ID>"
    ```

    To delete your Private Network, you can use the following call:

    ```sh
    curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $SECRET_KEY" \
        https://api.scaleway.com/vpc/v1/zones/$ZONE/private-networks/$PN_ID \
        -X DELETE
    ```

    Please note that the Private Network must be empty to be deleted, so be sure to remove any other
    Scaleway product from your network prior to deletion.

    ## Step 2: Plug Scaleway products to your Private Network

    Each product has its own API to interact with Private Networks, and each will be described here.

    ### Instance

    Scaleway Instances support Private Networks on a per-server basis. For this, you will need an
    instance in the same Availability Zone as your Private Network, and the Instance ID. For readability
    purposes, we will put the Instance ID in a variable:

    ```sh
    export SRV_ID="<Your Instance ID>"
    ```

    Then, use the following call to attach the Instance to your Private Network:

    ```sh
    curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $SECRET_KEY" \
        https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/$ZONE/servers/$SRV_ID/private_nics \
        -d '{"private_network_id": "'$PN_ID'"}'
    ```

    Keep the `id` field of the response: it is your Private NIC ID. For readability purposes, we will
    put it in a variable:

    ```sh
    export NIC_ID="<Your Private NIC ID>"
    ```

    Keep the `mac_address` field of the response, as it will allow you to identify the Private NIC
    inside your Instance. If successful, a new network interface will appear inside your Instance,
    ready to be configured to transmit traffic to other instances of the same network, with the MAC
    address returned by the API call.

    By running `dmesg`, you can confirm that the network interface has been plugged:

    ```
    [1579004.592869] pci 0000:00:05.0: [1af4:1000] type 00 class 0x020000
    [1579004.594835] pci 0000:00:05.0: reg 0x10: [io  0x0000-0x003f]
    [1579004.596715] pci 0000:00:05.0: reg 0x14: [mem 0x00000000-0x00000fff]
    [1579004.598732] pci 0000:00:05.0: reg 0x20: [mem 0x00000000-0x00003fff 64bit pref]
    [1579004.600765] pci 0000:00:05.0: reg 0x30: [mem 0x00000000-0x0007ffff pref]

    [1579004.604582] pci 0000:00:05.0: BAR 4: assigned [mem 0x100000c000-0x100000ffff 64bit pref]
    [1579004.605555] pci 0000:00:05.0: BAR 1: assigned [mem 0xc0003000-0xc0003fff]
    [1579004.606383] pci 0000:00:05.0: BAR 0: assigned [io  0x1000-0x103f]
    [1579004.607212] virtio-pci 0000:00:05.0: enabling device (0000 -> 0003)

    [1579004.644930] virtio_net virtio3 ens5: renamed from eth0
    ```

    By running `ip -br link`, you can confirm the presence of the network interface, and confirm its
    name if several networks are plugged to your instance:

    ```
    lo               UNKNOWN        00:00:00:00:00:00 <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP>
    ens2             UP             de:1c:94:44:d0:04 <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP>
    ens5             DOWN           02:00:00:00:00:31 <BROADCAST,MULTICAST>
    ens6             DOWN           02:00:00:00:01:5b <BROADCAST,MULTICAST>
    ens7             DOWN           02:00:00:00:01:5e <BROADCAST,MULTICAST>
    ```

    You can now refer to [our online documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/scaleway-private-networks/#-Configuring-a-Private-Network)
    on how to configure those network interfaces.

    To delete your Private NIC, which equates to unplugging your Instance from the Private Network, you
    can use the following call:

    ```sh
    curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $SECRET_KEY" \
        https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/$ZONE/servers/$SRV_ID/private_nics/$NIC_ID \
        -X DELETE
    ```

    Then the network interface should disappear from your Instance.

    A private network allows interconnecting your instances in an
    isolated and private network. The network reachability is limited
    to the instances that are on the same private network.  Network
    Interface Controllers (NICs) are available on the instance and can
    be freely managed (adding IP addresses, shutdown interface...)

    Note that an instance can be a part of multiple private networks.
