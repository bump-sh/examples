    ## Endpoints

    Scaleway instance API can be reached on

    - `https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/fr-par-1`
    - `https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/fr-par-2`
    - `https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/nl-ams-1`
    - `https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/pl-waw-1`

    Older endpoints are still reachable but should not be used for new projects

    - `https://cp-par1.scaleway.com`
    - `https://cp-ams1.scaleway.com`

    <Example>

    The following code is an example request to retrieve detailed information about a volume:

    ```
    % curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxx' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/fr-par-1/volumes/f929fe39-63f8-4be8-a80e-1e9c8ae22a76 -i

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: nginx
    Date: Thu, 22 May 2014 07:55:00 GMT
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 1345
    Connection: keep-alive
    Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=86400

    {
      "volumes": [
        {
          "export_uri": null,
          "id": "f929fe39-63f8-4be8-a80e-1e9c8ae22a76",
          "name": "volume-0-1",
          "organization": "000a115d-2852-4b0a-9ce8-47f1134ba95a",
          "server": null,
          "size": 10000000000,
          "volume_type": "l_ssd"
        },
        {
          "export_uri": null,
          "id": "0facb6b5-b117-441a-81c1-f28b1d723779",
          "name": "volume-0-2",
          "organization": "000a115d-2852-4b0a-9ce8-47f1134ba95a",
          "server": null,
          "size": 20000000000,
          "volume_type": "l_ssd"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    </Example>

    ## Pagination

    Most of listing requests receive a paginated response.

    **Paginated request**

    Requests against paginated endpoints accept two `query` arguments:

    - `page`, a positive integer to choose the page to return.
    - `per_page`, an positive integer lower or equal to 100 to select the number of
      items to return. The default value is `50`.

    Paginated endpoints usually also accept filters to search and sort results.
    These filters are documented along each endpoint documentation.

    **Paginated response**

    ```bash
    % curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: <token>' 'https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/fr-par-1/images/?page=2&per_page=10' -i
    HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    [...]
    X-Total-Count: 209
    [...]
    ```

    The `X-Total-Count` header contains the total number of items for the resource.

    Server types are denomination of the different instances we provide.
    Scaleway offers **Virtual Cloud** and **dedicated GPU** instances.

    **Virtual Cloud Instances**

    Virtual cloud instances are offering the best performance/price ratio for most workloads. Different CPU architectures are proposed: The **Development** and **General Purpose** ranges are based on AMD EPYC CPUs. The **ARM64** range is based on Cavium Thunder X ARM CPUs.

    * The **Development** instances range provides stable and consistent performance for development needs.
      Spin up a development or test environment within seconds.
      Refer to the [Development Instance offer details](https://www.scaleway.com/en/development-instances/) for more information.

    * The **General Purpose** instances range is the solution for demanding workloads.
      Powerful AMD EPYC CPUs back those instances and offer up to 48 Cores, 256GB of RAM and 600GB of replicated local NVMe SSD storage.
      Refer to the [General Purpose offer details](https://www.scaleway.com/en/general-purpose-instances/) for more information.

    * The **ARM** instances range is based on Cavium ThunderX SoCs and provides up to 64 Cores ARM 64bit, 128GB of RAM and 1TB SSD storage.
      Refer to the [ARM offer details](https://www.scaleway.com/en/arm-instances) for more information.

    **Dedicated GPU Instances**

    GPU instances are very powerful compute instances, providing lots of RAM, vCPU, and storage.

    They are equipped with Nvidia Tesla P100 GPUs, which are designed for handling rapidly, a massive amount of data.
    They are useful for heavy data processing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, video encoding, rendering, and so on.
    The GPU is dedicated to each instance and directly exposed through PCI-e.
    For more information, refer to [GPU Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/gpu-instances/).
- name: Images
  description: |
    Images are backups of your instances.
    You can reuse that image to restore your data or create a series of instances with a predefined configuration.

    An image is a complete backup of your server including all volumes.
- name: Security Groups
  description: |
    A security group is a set of firewall rules on a set of instances.
    Security groups enable to create rules that either drop or allow incoming traffic from certain ports of your instances.

    Security Groups are stateful by default which means return traffic is automatically allowed, regardless of any rules.
    As a contrary, you have to switch in a stateless mode to define explicitly allowed.
- name: User-Data
  description: |
    User data is a key value store API you can use to provide data from and to your server without authentication.

    As an example of use, Scaleway images contain the script scw-generate-ssh-keys which generates SSH server’s host keys then stores their fingerprints as user data under the key “ssh-host-fingerprints”.
    This way, we ensure they are really connecting to their Scaleway instance and they are not victim of a man-in-the-middle attack.

    There are two endpoints to access user data:
     - **From a running instance**, by using the metadata API at http://169.254.42.42/user_data.
       To enhance security, we only allow user data viewing and editing as root.
       To know if the query is issued by the root user, we only accept queries made from a local port below 1024 (by default, non-root users can’t bind ports below 1024).
       To specify the local port with cURL, use `curl --local-port 1-1024 http://169.254.42.42/user_data`
     - **From the instance API** at using methods described bellow.
- name: Server types
  description: |
    Server types will answer with all instance types available in a given zone.
    Each of these types will contains all the features of the instance (CPU, RAM, Storage) with their associated pricing.
- name: Volume types
  description: |
    Volume types will answer with all volume types available in a given zone.
    Each of these types will contains all the capabilities and constraints of the volume (min size, max size, snapshot).
- name: IPs
  description: |
    A flexible IP address is an IP address which you hold independently of any server.
    You can attach it to any of your servers and do live migration of the IP address between your servers.

    Be aware that attaching a flexible IP address to a server will remove the previous public IP address of the server and cut any ongoing public connection to the server.
- name: Volumes
  description: |
    A volume is where you store your data inside your instance. It
    appears as a block device on Linux that you can use to create
    a filesystem and mount it.

    We have two different types of volume (`volume_type`):
      - `l_ssd` is a local block storage: your data is downloaded on
        the hypervisor and you need to power off your instance to attach
        or detach a volume.
      - `b_ssd` is a remote block storage: your data is stored on a
        centralised cluster. You can plug and unplug a volume while
        your instance is running. As of today, `b_ssd` is only available
        for `DEV1`, `GP1` and `RENDER` offers.

    Minimum and maximum volume sizes for each volume types can be queried
    from the zone `/products/volumes` API endpoint. _I.e_ for:
      - `fr-par-1`  use https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/fr-par-1/products/volumes
      - `nl-ams-1`  use https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/nl-ams-1/products/volumes

    Each types of volumes is also subject to a global quota for the sum of all the
    volumes. This quota depends of the level of support and may be
    changed on demand.

    Be wary that when terminating an instance, if you want to keep
    your block storage volume, **you must** detach it beforehand you
    issue the `terminate` call.

    When using multiple block devices, it's advised to mount them by
    using their UUID instead of their device name. A device name is
    subject to change depending on the volumes order. Block devices
    UUIDs can be found in `/dev/disk/by-id/`.
- name: Snapshots
  description: |
    Snapshots contain the data of a specific volume at a particular point in time.
    The data can include the instance's operating system,
    configuration information or files stored on the volume.

    A snapshot can be done from a specific volume (for example you
    have a server with a volume containing the OS and another one
    containing the application data, and you want to use different
    snapshot strategies on both volumes).

    Snapshots only work on `l_ssd` volume type at the moment. `b_ssd`
    snapshots will be available starting 2020.
- name: Bootscripts
  description: |
    Bootscripts are a combination of a [Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) and of an [initrd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk).
    They tell to the instance how to start and configure its starting process and settings.

    Bootscripts are available on all of instances types (DEV, GP, RENDER, ARM).

    Scaleway recommends that you take the "localboot" boot method that will automatically launch your instance with your locally installed kernel.
    It gives you full control over the booting process of your instance.

    Scaleway also provides a "rescue" bootscript that can be used when your instance gets a failure and if you need a clean operating system to access your data.
- name: Placement Groups
  description: |
    Placement groups allow the user to express a preference regarding
    the physical position of a group of instances. It'll let the user
    choose to either group instances on the same physical hardware for
    best network throughput and low latency or to spread instances on
    far away hardware to reduce the risk of physical failure.

    The operating mode is selected by a `policy_type`. Two policy
    types are available:
      - `low_latency` will group instances on the same hypervisors
      - `max_availability` will spread instances on far away hypervisors

    The `policy_type` is set by default to `max_availability`.

    For each policy types, one of the two `policy_mode` may be selected:
      - `optional` will start your instances even if the constraint is not respected
      - `enforced` guarantee that if the instance starts, the constraint is respected

    The `policy_mode` is set by default to `optional`.

    A Private NIC is the network interface that connects a server to a
    Private Network. There can be at most one Private NIC connecting a
    server to a network.
